Career Path Recommender
CareerPathRecommender.java is a simple Java console application that helps users explore possible career options based on their interests, personality traits, and preferences. This program asks a set of interactive questions, such as whether the user prefers working with data, enjoys creative or analytical tasks, is more comfortable with people or machines, and has an interest in technology or social work. Based on the user's responses, the program suggests several suitable career paths that align with the provided answers.

This application is designed to be user-friendly and educational, especially for students or individuals exploring different career directions. It covers fields such as data science, software development, social work, design, finance, and more. While it doesn't replace professional career counseling, it provides a fun and insightful way to reflect on one's strengths and interests.

To run this program, make sure you have Java installed on your system. Save the file as CareerPathRecommender.java, then compile and run it using the terminal or command prompt. Here's how:

Once the program starts, answer each question by typing responses like yes, no, creative, analytical, people, or machines. After answering all questions, you'll receive a list of recommended careers based on your inputs.

This is a beginner-level project ideal for learning basic Java concepts such as conditionals, user input, string manipulation, and logic flow. Feel free to modify or expand the questions and logic to fit your own ideas or learning goals.
